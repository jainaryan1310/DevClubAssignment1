The Dev club is not just a group of like minded people, but is rather a platform which let's these like minded and dedicated individuals to come together, improve themselves while doing something they absolutely love. As an end result each and every one of the members of the club can use this club to learn and get better at real world development applications. The aforementioned favourable result is achieved by collaboration of some of the code developers on campus through the process of brain-storming and collectively solving some of the most challenging software or code development problems.
